# yo waddup im luke (⌐■_■)
not so serious software developer and coffee enthusiast. I love all the low level stuff I can get my hands on and strive to make cool stuff people didn't even think was possible! I mainly use `C#` for a majority of my higher level application projects but I also use `Java` and `C` for various other stuff.
