# hey, im luke üëã
not so serious software engineer and coffee enthusiast. I love all the low level stuff I can get my hands on and strive to make cool stuff people didn't even think was possible! I mainly use `C#` for a majority of my higher level application projects but I also use `Java`, `C`, and a bit of `x86asm` for some other projects.

# a couple of my fav projects:

---

### üíø operating system
I'm working on an x86-64 OS/kernel and gotten to the point of some of the basic functions like cpu identification, SSE operations, and im currently working on keyboard input and bios calls. this project isn't public but i figured i'd share!

### ‚ö°textmod 2
a neat mod for discord i wrote over a couple of months; it's completely external and lets you run cool commands in discord that regular people will rave over. it also has tons of utilities including animated rich presence and an autocounter, to name a few.

### üñ•Ô∏è mc-compiled
procedural programming language which compiles straight down to minecraft bedrock edition commands. it extends a majority of the functionality in the regular command system including giving enchanted items, creating custom blocks, items, entities, and even performing fixed point decimal math. there's tons of insane features which can assist you!
